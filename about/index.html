<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<p>Hey! My name's Ed Prosser, and I'm a nerd. Now that the confession's out of the way, here are some facts about my life.</p>
<p><ul>
  <li>I play a lot of dungeons and dragons. 5e, Pathfinder, Dogs in the Vineyard, Uncharted Worlds...</li>
  <li>When I'm not playing Dungeons and Dragons, I'm playing videogames. Usually League of Legends or Hearthstone.</li>
  <li>Top lane is my second home. Yorick/Shen/Fiora.</li>
  <li>In my day job I work as an Information Developer for IBM (don't ask me what Information Developer means either).</li>
  <li>If somehow you're still reading, you can find my CV <a href"../about/CV.html">[here]</a></li>
</ul>
