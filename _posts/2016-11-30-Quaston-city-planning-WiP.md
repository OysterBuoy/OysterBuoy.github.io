## History

The City of Quaston was founded by a banding together of Gnomish clans some thousands of years ago. A folk legend telling of the founding of the city describes how the clans were beset by the beasts of the forest, and were driven into the caves beneath Mt. Orryn. Wandering in the unusual and unnerving caves, the clans formed uneasy alliances, which persist, more or less, to this day.

Hundreds of years later, the great city of Quaston  flourishes still, in an enormous cavern under the center of Mt. Orryn. Travellers from the great forest are common and gnomes come and go as they please.

## Geography

Quaston is situated in a colossal cavern deep under Mt Orryn. About 1km from the surface in the foothills of Mt Orryn and in the heart of the great forest. The subterranean environments around Quaston are dangerous, but the common paths to the surface and to the more commonly visited caves and tunnels have long since been made safe. The tunnel system has never fully been explored however, and what mysteries lurk in the darkness, none can say.

## Cityscape

Sitting as the city does in a large, natural light is non-existent. In the wealthier districts strings of lights crisscross the streets and the inhabitants are bathed in the multi-coloured glow of magical and mundane lanterns.

### Districts

#### The Glittering Column

The huge pillar in the center of the cavern is known as the Glittering Column. Over the thousands of years since the founding of the city, an entire district has been carved out inside the column. Now, all the noble clans of Quaston make their homes inside the glittering column, so named because inside the black marbled exterior are large crystal hollows.

In the caverns beneath the Glittering Column lies the Enclave of Stone, the guild of wizards who are the balance to the power of the gnomish clans. The Enclave are fiercely posessive of their knowledge, seeking to keep their secrets from all others. They have an extensive library and archive which can be browsed for a fee, but many of the most treasured scrolls and books are kept separate from this collection.

#### Marble Row

The marbled row is the middle class circle. There are tradesmen and merchants of every conceivable craft, with many especially fine stoneworkers. The Guild of Cartographers owns a large building in Marble Row. They are dedicated to mapping both the world at large, and the voluminous caverns beneath Mt Orryn. Cartography is a dangerous profession, and many expiditions into the deeper caverns don't make it back. The guild is a good place for adventurers to find work guarding map-makers as they explore the recesses of Mt Orryn.

Many Mountain Dwarves live and work in Marble Row as blacksmiths, jewelers, and merchants.

#### Pebbleside

Pebbleside is the most populous of the cities districts, and the district where most of the Wood Elves reside. Unlike the dwarvish residents of the city, most wood elves are unfamiliar with living below ground, and only remain because they are unable to live with their kin in the Great Forest. Whether that's for reasons of banishment or exile, poverty, shame, 

#### The Gravel Heap

The Gravel Heap is the diminutive name for the slums surrounding the city. It exists mostly outside the main city walls. The rulers of Quaston have paid little heed to the welfare of the cities poorest citizens over the centuries, and so the slums have grown larger and larger with each passing year. Once a year, the wizards of the Enclave of Stone leave their place of study in the center of the city and unite to burn the homeless and destitute from the city in a ritual known as the Cleanse.

##### Beggars Parade

Beggars parade is the main approach to Quaston from outside the walls.
