## DM priorities:

- Reveal the letter from Allana in Hollynys' case file.
  - "Hollynys, I'm sorry we haven't spoken in quite so long, and I still wouldn't call you my friend, but I need your help. This is your mess and I'm out here trying to fix it. I'm in Quaston, ostensibly, and originally, to use their archive, to try and see if I could work out what the hell is going on. I don't know how you fucked up, but I know enough to know you did. I'm scared Hollynys. Something's not quite right here, I haven't told my hosts exactly what I'm looking for. They seem to know too much. Making veiled references. I've got a bad feeling about this Hollynys. I need you to come and back me up. I've got friends in Kirkrindell, they should be staying with Ammanar, if neither of you have heard from me after this letter. Please, come and find me."
- Reveal what exactly Hollynys and her friends were trying to summon
  - An elemental lord of the earth.
    - Why? To contest the Trellsh Imperial Army.
  - Hollynys doesn't know exactly what went wrong with the summoning she felt the influence of Necromancy during the ritual.
  - They felt the summoning succeed, and a being of immense power in their midst. Almost instantly, they were all knocked from their feet and blackness consumed their vision. There was a large crater in the center of the circle, several of the wizards were dead, and all plants within 50ft were dead. This was about 6 weeks ago.


## Session Begins

The session opens on a darkened hillside, the group sitting around a campfire in a circle of small tents. The hillside is covered in stumps of trees long cut down. A frantic Ammanar is questioning the group, and the unconscious form of Hollynys can be seen lying inside a tent.

How does everyone look? Tired? Scared? Excited?

_The PC's describe_

_Pick a person_ you look up and realise Ammanar has been talking to you...

Ammanar: Well? How did you manage to get her out of the city? I could hear the city bells sounding all the way out here! And from the top of the hill you can still see the fire!

_PC's describe their escape from the city_

Ammanar: You're lucky I thought ahead. <Gestures to the huge form of Mike Bison shifting around behind the circle of tents> I brought your strange menagerie with me, and I tell you, I was damned lucky to get your gear out of the city. <Pauses> For now I suggest we put off whatever decisions must be made until tomorrow. I must talk with Hollynys but she's in no condition right now. I will be forever grateful to you for your efforts in rescuing her, but now we all must rest.

_Night passes. Is anyone going to stand guard or take watch?_

**If a PC stands guard**

_During the night you hear shifting and turning from the tents. A woman's voice you don't recognise cries out, then abruptly stops. It's coming from Hollyny's tent. You hear more shifting the movement, then nothing._

**In the morning**

_Dawn comes late, this close to the end of the year, and it's the first frost of the year as you pull yourselves from warm bedrolls and get ready for the day. Who's up first?_

_As you get up, you hear murmuring voices, and see Ammanar sitting by a crackling fire talking with Hollynys. A copper frying pan is heating up on a tripod over the campfire._

Hollynys: It's got to be done Ammanar, and I need your help to do it. Don't fight me on this.

Ammanar: But now? Surely you should recover your strength a little first.

_While Ammanar is talking, Hollynys begins unwinding the bandages around the stumps of her wrists. As the wounds are uncovered, bloody bandages drop to the floor and Hollynys blanches visibly._

Hollynys: That's exactly what I intend to do. And this is the first step. I'd appreciate you making it quick though.

_Want to do anything?_

**If the PCs intervene**

Hollynys: These wounds must be sealed. Thank you for rescuing me, I don't know what I've done to deserve such heroics, but this is what must be done, and you don't get a say in this.

_A piercing cry sets nearby birds to flight as Ammanar holds the red hot pan first to one of Hollynys' wrists, then the other. Hollynys is unconscious on the ground._

Ammanar: <To the PC's> I think we should rest here for the day. Hollynys must recover her strength, and I need to check that her wounds have closed.

**The long and the short of it**

Hollynys is going to _Quaston NAME_ to look for Allana. She explains what she tried to summon with the other members of the cabal. **See explanation at the top**

Hollynys: I intend to travel to Quaston to find Allana. She's right, this is my mess, but in my present *ahem* state <gestures with her arms> I'm going to need some help if anything goes south. Will you help me?

The next job is to retrieve some gems from a mine in the area. The gems are required in order to cast the teleportation spell to reach Quaston. Hollynys will travel with the players to the mine, but will not enter and fight, claiming to be of little use.

## The Quest

- The gems are valuable and are a known reagent in some spells.
- The Empire have taken control of the supply.
- Lots of mine workers and veterans.
  - Currently not operational, the empire has shut it down for seemingly no reason, other than the stones are used for magical spells.
- At the center of the mine is a crystal golem, it is _enormous_ and has been chained there for centuries.
- Players must choose to take crystals from it in order to cast the teleport spell.
  - They may try to bargain with it to get it to give the crystals willingly.


1. Travel to the mine.
  - Pretty close. Not too hard to find. DC 12 Survival.
  - Cave system in a secluded bay on the shore.

2. Gain entrance.
  - Lots of outbuildings.
    - A dock
      - Pier with two berths.
      - About 100ft into the sea.
      - Deep enough for a reasonable vessel to dock (at least as large as the fishing ship the PCs were on)
    - Walls and a gatehouse to the mine.
      - Walls contain all buildings except for the pier
      - 12ft high stone/timber walls
    - Living quarters for miners.
      - Group living quarters with curtains between individual spaces.
      - Each space enough for a single bed, and a chest.
      - About the size of a work cubicle.
    - Admin building, near the dock.
      - Tally of ships docking, when etc.
      - No documents have been done for the last two weeks.
    - Cookhouses and a rudimentary tavern.
      - Tavern: The Rusty Pick
        - Gambling tables
        - Shitty beer
        - No places to sleep, there are no visitors here.
    - No roads lead to this bay, the walls are much too steep.
    - One larger house for the foreman.
      - Still just a couple of rooms.
      - Communal toilets and bathing place.

3. Gather crystals.
  - Giant crystal golem.
    - Crystal golem is beginning to die and turn black.
    - The golem knows that it is dying
      - It can feel the call of its master/superior.
      - It feels familiar, yet strange.
      - The call is killing it.
      -

## Session Ends

_The morning after_...

_Ammanar will appear much more wizardly, and thank the party for opening his eyes, and helping him become himself again. He takes his leave, saying that he'll hopefully see them again in future, and that clearly there is much more to learn and to fight against. He reveals himself as essentially a badass war wizard and leaves._


Total roll for proficiency for escaping: 23.

The empire will begin following traces, will find the camp in a few days, but may lose the trail. Roll for Ammanar's skill to evade them.

100xp - so far.

3 rds till both a patrol and the commander and 2 guards come looking.
