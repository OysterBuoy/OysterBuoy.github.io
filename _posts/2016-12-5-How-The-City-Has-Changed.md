Well I've been having a lot of fun writing up the background and feel of the Gnomish city of Quaston, but with my players rapidly advancing on the city itself, it's about time I worked out not only what the city _was_ like, but rather, the condition we find it in today. So, without further ado: The fall of Quaston.

**Important:** If you're one of my players reading these posts (sneaky devil, you) then cease and desist with greatest immediacy. You'll spoil the _entire rest of the campaign if you read this, so STAHP._

A new force has emerged to take control of the city. From the Enclave of Stone a new worship has arisen, the worship of the reincarnated Lord of Stone; Tharizdun. The necromancers of the Enclave of Stone have forced many of the people in the city to convert to worshipping the Eternal Lord of Stone. 

There is a curfew in effect, none are permitted to walk the streets after 6pm. All of the standard city guard have been dismissed. and a new for patrols the city streets after curfew.

There are rumours that there is worship of Vecna, God of Necromancy in the Glittering Column.

## Effect on Districts

### Glittering Column

The Glittering Column is a changed place. The crystal caverns inside the column have grown dark, the crystals becoming clouded and black. Sharp obsidian shards line the floors.

Nothing has been heard from Clan Beren or Clan Garrick for about a week, the other two clans, Clan Turen and Clan Folkor have joined the new priesthood. This information is not available to players yet. 

Clan Beren and Garrick were all murdered in their ancestral homes. 

### Marble Row

Some businesses are shutting. There has been a spate of arrests as temples are raided and closed and priests charged for nonsense crimes. Most temples are closed. Priests of the Lord of Eternal Stone preach on the streets. Their is a distinct sense of fear in Marble Row. There are rumours that nothing has been seen of any members of Clan Beren or Clan Garrick since the council announced that the Enclave would join them in ruling the city.

### Pebbleside

Many people are afraid, but some are cautiously optimistic. Much of the crime has stopped in Pebbleside, some of the temples have closed, but they believe the Councils communications about their corruption. The Eternal Stone Priests have been handing out food to the needy in return for attending their sermons. The Cleanse was due to sweep through this part of the city in 3 weeks time, so many of the slums residents have pushed into the city. The Enclave of Stone now doesn't care about the Cleanse. 



## Factions and NPCs

### The Clans

**Clan Beren** have all been slain. Their home inside the Glittering Column has been sealed as though it were never there. The  stone has closed over the doors and windows. Should the PCs find their way inside, they will find bloodstains and broken doors, as though someone forced their way in, killing anyone in their path. The residents fought a retreat, but were unable to rally and were all slain. This was a messy and noisy affair. **Lilli Beren** survived, and hides in the sewers half mad.

  **Lilli Beren** hides in the sewers beneath the glittering column.

**Clan Turen** were a clan of declining influence who drove out a family member for being a monster. That monster returned and now serves the **Enclave of Stone**. The Turen family now serve the Enclave, driven half mad, barely keeping control of their monster.

  **Donella Turen** now holds a minor position in the Enclave of Stone, but the visions that have been visited upon her in rituals. She can often be heard singing in the Column, and has begun singing the praises of the Eternal Lord of Stone. 
  **

**Clan Folkor** have engaged with the Enclave of Stone, but reluctantly. Their patriarch, Alston Folkor, is trying to preserve the clan by adapting to the new enclave. He is vocally supportive of the Enclave representative on the council.
