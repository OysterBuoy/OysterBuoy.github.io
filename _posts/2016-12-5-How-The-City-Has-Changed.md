**Important: If you're one of my players reading these posts (sneaky devil, you) then cease and desist with greatest immediacy. You'll spoil the _entire rest of the campaign if you read this, so STAHP._**

Well I've been having a lot of fun writing up the background and feel of the Gnomish city of Quaston, but with my players rapidly advancing on the city itself, it's about time I worked out not only what the city _was_ like, but rather, the condition we find it in today. So, without further ado: The fall of Quaston.

***

A new force has emerged to take control of the city. From the Enclave of Stone a new worship has arisen, the worship of the reincarnated Lord of Stone; Tharizdun. The necromancers of the Enclave of Stone have forced many of the people in the city to convert to worshipping the Eternal Lord of Stone. 

There is a curfew in effect, none are permitted to walk the streets after 6pm. All of the standard city guard have been dismissed. and a new for patrols the city streets after curfew.

There are rumours that there is worship of Vecna, God of Necromancy in the Glittering Column.

## Effect on Districts

### Glittering Column

The Glittering Column is a changed place. The crystal caverns inside the column have grown dark, the crystals becoming clouded and black. Sharp obsidian shards line the floors.

Nothing has been heard from Clan Beren or Clan Garrick for about a week, the other two clans, Clan Turen and Clan Folkor have joined the new priesthood. This information is not available to players yet. 

Clan Beren and Garrick were all murdered in their ancestral homes. 

### Marble Row

Some businesses are shutting. There has been a spate of arrests as temples are raided and closed and priests charged for nonsense crimes. Most temples are closed. Priests of the Lord of Eternal Stone preach on the streets. Their is a distinct sense of fear in Marble Row. There are rumours that nothing has been seen of any members of Clan Beren or Clan Garrick since the council announced that the Enclave would join them in ruling the city.

### Pebbleside

Many people are afraid, but some are cautiously optimistic. Much of the crime has stopped in Pebbleside, some of the temples have closed, but they believe the Councils communications about their corruption. The Eternal Stone Priests have been handing out food to the needy in return for attending their sermons. The Cleanse was due to sweep through this part of the city in 3 weeks time, so many of the slums residents have pushed into the city. The Enclave of Stone now doesn't care about the Cleanse. 



## Factions

### The Clans

**Clan Beren** have all been slain. Their home inside the Glittering Column has been sealed as though it were never there. The  stone has closed over the doors and windows. Should the PCs find their way inside, they will find bloodstains and broken doors, as though someone forced their way in, killing anyone in their path. The residents fought a retreat, but were unable to rally and were all slain. This was a messy and noisy affair. **Lilli Beren** survived, and hides in the sewers half mad.

**Clan Turen** were a clan of declining influence who drove out a family member for being a monster. That monster returned and now serves the **Enclave of Stone**. The Turen family now serve the Enclave, driven half mad, barely keeping control of their monster.

**Clan Folkor** have engaged with the Enclave of Stone, but reluctantly. Their patriarch, Alston Folkor, is trying to preserve the clan by adapting to the new enclave. He is vocally supportive of the Enclave representative on the council. Alston's firstborn son **Alvyn Folkor** is being held by the Enclave of Stone in order to ensure loyalty. 

**Clan Garrick** have been ritually sacrificed. Kellen Garrick resisted the changes to the council. Their ancestral home shows signs of struggle. All of the family was taken to the Enclave under cover of darkness. 

### The Enclave of Stone

Once a paragon of wizardry and learning, the Enclave has become obsessed by Necromancy, and elemental worship. The wizards have collectively done a deal with Thazrin, the Eternal Lord of Stone, for power in exchange for helping him with his plans. He has shown them the power at the heart of the world, and offers them a portion.

## NPCs

**The Noble Clans**

_Lilli Beren_ hides in the sewers beneath the glittering column, half mad with fear. Nervous eye twitch, ruddy red cheeks, stumbles and stammers, taps fingers constantly, argumentative.

_Donella Turen_ is half mad, and a true believer in the cult of eternal earth. She wears threabare out of fashion clothes, and is lithe and graceful, once known for her beautiful dancing, but is now pale and sallow. She sings beautifully, and ethereally. Middle aged. She was the hostess of Allana in her time in Quaston. When they abducted the Garrick clan, they took Allana as well.
