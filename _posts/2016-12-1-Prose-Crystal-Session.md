It wasn't easy, but they'd done it. At least _his_ part had been clean, he thought. Or, as clean as suffocating a man and demolishing the guardhouse with explosives _could_ be, not sloshing through some flooded dungeon [to rescue a witch]. Wearily, Geth lifted his head to look across the campfire at his travelling companions, risking the stinging rain that comes at years end.

Lyra was scratching at the stump of her leg again, the affectation so frequent as to become unconscious. At least she'll have someone to share her frustrations with now. What a motley crew we've become.

The sleeping form of their charge was visible, huddled in one of the tents which circled the fire; a witch, tortured by the Empire, her hands amputated for the crime of using magic to resist the ceaseless expansion of their borders. Too much had happened, unnatural stone driving people mad, thieves and wizards, and more than a few bodies buried - and in one case, dissolved.
