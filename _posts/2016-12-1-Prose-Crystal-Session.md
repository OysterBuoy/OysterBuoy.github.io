It wasn't easy, but they'd done it. At least _his_ part had been clean, he thought. Or, as clean as suffocating a man and demolishing the guardhouse with explosives _could_ be, not sloshing through some flooded dungeon [to rescue a witch]. Wearily, Geth lifted his head to look across the campfire at his travelling companions, risking the stinging rain that comes at years end.

Lyra was scratching at the stump of her leg again, the affectation so frequent as to become unconscious. At least she'll have someone to share her frustrations with now. What a motley crew we've become. Lyra; a monk with a wooden leg, not that it seemed to slow her, Zook; a frankly unhinged wizard with the most literal of small man complexes, and himself, a thief. Assassin now, he supposed, and for what?

"Well? How did you manage to get her out of the city?" 

Geth looked over to meet the eyes of their purported benefactor, Ammanar, ex-wizard-turned-philosopher, and as far as Geth was concerned, an overly academic busybody only useful for what he could tell others. [He got me some explosives though which is something.]

"'Liberated' a few wagons. Managed to get out of the east gate before the city was locked down. Never thought the whole body-under-a-heap-of-straw thing actually worked." Geth replied, "Lucky it did too, I was the only one of us in any shape to put up much of a fight, not that even I can take on a cityfull of guards alone. Not unprepared anyway."

The sleeping form of Hollynys was visible huddled in one of their tents in the endless landscape of treestumps. As a wizard, she'd been tortured; hands cut off for the crime of resisting the Empire's ceaseless expansion. And now we need her. To know her role in this. Too much had happened recently, unnatural stones driving people mad, thieves and wizards and assassins, and more than a few bodies buried - and in one case, dissolved... and she's at the root it of it all.

"We should get some sleep. I'll take first watch." Geth muttered, "Bubbles can keep me company." The mastiff opened his eyes fom his position near the fire, gazing at Geth pleadingly, and closed his eyes again. "Or not."

A long cold night of being sitting on a tree stump and being rained on. And not a word of thanks for it, and now I get to freeze to death in a drafty tent. 

This witch had better be worth it.

***

A scream cut through Geth's sleep. Gasping as he clawed for wakefullness and his weapons, Geth scrambled out of the tent and into the weak sunlight of morning. 

Zook and Ammanar crouched next to the fire, over a now-unconscious Hollynys, each holding one handle of a large copper pan, pressing the red-hot metal into Hollynys' wounds, the stumps where her hands once were. 

"You could have woken me." Geth grumbled, "The way she screamed I thought another of those Imperial assassins had descended upon us." He turned to walk away, eyeing the bloody bandages, now discarded, "Her wounds are sealed though?"

Tossing the pan aside, Zook cocked his head and peered at the seared flesh. "Seems so."

Hollynys stood, pale still, but determined, reading the letter aloud:

_"Hollynys, I’m sorry we haven’t spoken in quite so long, and I still wouldn’t call you my friend, but I need your help. This is your mess and I’m out here trying to fix it. I’m in Quaston, ostensibly, and originally, to use their archive, to try and see if I could work out what the hell is going on. I don’t know how you fucked up, but I know enough to know you did. I’m scared Hollynys. Something’s not quite right here, I haven’t told my hosts exactly what I’m looking for. They seem to know too much. Making veiled references. I’ve got a bad feeling about this Hollynys. I need you to come and back me up. I’ve got friends in Kirkrindell, they should be staying with Ammanar, if neither of you have heard from me after this letter. Please, come and find me. 
  Allana.”_
