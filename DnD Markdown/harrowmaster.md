# Master of the Harrow

Notes on the Harrow Master:

the past

- What is his birth name?
  - Vidiq Hakim

- Where was he born?
  - Absalom, the most populous and powerful city on Golarion.
    - Younger son to a minor noble family, part of House Damaq.

- What was his family like?
  - Minor players involved in high politics.
  - A house in decline.
  - Constant reminders of past glory.
  - A line of Captains of merchant vessels in the fleet of another branch of House Damaq.

- How did his sorcerous powers manifest?
  - It was known since he was young that he was sensitive to magical stimuli, although he never showed any awareness of magic consciously. Neither could he be taught, tutors throughout his childhood lamented his lack of attention and proclaimed that although the boy was sensitive to magic, he could never be a practitioner. His awareness of magic was always a tangiential, manifesting as bad feelings and limited foresight.
  - As a young man, Vidiq served aboard a merchant vessel, his first command of a ship of House Damaq. Before putting out to sea, Vidiq was plagued by nightmares of vicious storms and screaming horses descending on the ship. Late that autumn, on the return journey to Absalom, they were caught in a sudden storm; waves twice the height of their craft crashed over them, sail tearing and mast splintering beneath the weight of water. Vidiq cried out and threw his arms over his face to shield himself, knowing it would never be enough. By some miracle, the surging waters parted around him thundering against the deck and sailors unfortunate enough to be running for cover. Vidiq felt the water hammering against his shield, his strength of will being crushed by the relentless waters. Hard as he tried, and as skilled as the crew were, it wasn't enough, the ship and it's cargo and most of the crew were consigned to the bed of the Inner Sea. As Vidiq and the ships officers limped back to Absalom in a dory he felt strange new powers flooding him, he heard the words of his companions before they spoke, knew their minds before they themselves did; knew, with an impossible certainty, that they would survive the journey to Absalom. After two weeks, and near starvation, they returned to Absalom. Enduring the shame of losing his crew and cargo, Vidiq pursued the mystery of his newfound power, visiting almost every Harrow readerand fortune teller in the city.
