# The Gnome City of Quaston

## History

The City of Quaston was founded by a banding together of Gnomish clans some thousands of years ago. A folk legend telling of the founding of the city describes how the clans were beset by the beasts of the forest, and were driven into the caves beneath Mt. Orryn. Wandering in the unusual and unnerving caves, the clans formed uneasy alliances, which persist, more or less, to this day.

Hundreds of years later, the great city of Quaston  flourishes still, in an enormous cavern under the center of Mt. Orryn. Travellers from the great forest are common and gnomes come and go as they please.

## Geography

Quaston is situated in a colossal cavern deep under Mt Orryn. About 1km from the surface in the foothills of Mt Orryn and in the heart of the great forest. The subterranean environments around Quaston are dangerous, but the common paths to the surface and to the more commonly visited caves and tunnels have long since been made safe. The tunnel system has never fully been explored however, and what mysteries lurk in the darkness, none can say.

The city itself is split into 4 concentric circles towards the towers and steeples of the inner districts. Each is basically a city unto itself, with its own markets, merchants, craftsmen, etc.

-Out-
Slums - traditionally outside the walls, but each year the population pushes into the city, only to be driven out in the purging of the city by the ruling wizards alliance.
Poor - Most of the wood elves live here.
Merchants and middle classmen - Many merchants claim distant relation to the founding clans, though most can't prove it.
Ruling - The ruling clans claim to be direct descendants of the clans which founded the city. Newer clans have come from outside and have gained much wealth and influence, and are now demanding representation. The ruling circle is entirely carved into a giant pillar which intersects with the floor in the center of the cavern.
