# Dogs in the Vineyard - Cyberpunk hack

Instead of towns, players meet situations.
Instead of relationships with people, they are more likely with corporations. For example: "I'm in deep shit with Fujimora Corp. 2d4."
The Dogs don't represent a religion, rather, an ideology, a counter-corporate culture dedicated to sticking it to the man and getting away with the money.

In most settings there will be:

- Mostly corporate employees.
- A hacker.
- Engineer.
- Factory workers.
- Gangs.
- Corporate security.
- Governmental police forces.
- Doctors.
- Cybertech
- Hokey religions
  - Tech evangelist
- Safehouses.
- Corporate offices.
- An underclass.
  - Non-corporate or non-caring corporate workers.
    - e.g. food production
    - factory workers
    - cleaning staff
    - point of sale workers.
